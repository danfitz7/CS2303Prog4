Version:			1.0
Project ID:			Program 4
CS Class:			CS 2303
Programming Language:		C++
OS/Hardware dependencies:	n/a

Problem Description:		A Cross Reference Generator

Overall Design:				Words are recorded in a sorted binary tree structure as they are read in
	System structure	
	Data representation		Words are stored in nodes of a tree, where each node contains a word, a vector containing all the lines it appears on, and left and right child nodes.
	Algorithms 				Words are inserted in the sorted tree by traversing the tree until the word is found and that node it updated or the location it should be in is found and the node is created

Program Assumptions 
      and Restrictions:		n/a

Interfaces:					n/a
	User
	File/D-B
	Program/Module

Implementation Details:
	Data					Binary tree is implemented in a class for a tree node
	Variables				DEBUG in prog4.h controls verbose debug printing
	Algorithm				n/a

How to build the program:	make

Program Source:				prog4.cpp prog4.h node.cpp node.h
